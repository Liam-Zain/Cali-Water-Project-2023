# California Water Quality Analysis 2023
 
 This project entails a comprehensive analysis of compliance of stream water at California monitor stations for the year 2023. It seeks to identify critical exceedances of EPA guidelines and limits on major inorganic toxins and contaminants, namely Arsenic, Copper, Fluoride, Lead, Mercury, Nitrates, Selenium, Uranium as well as water turbidity. These specific contaminants were chosen as they pose high level acute and chronic toxicity threats to individuals if consumed and should, therefore be closely monitored.

 This analysis culminates with a dashboard showing distribution of problem stations, areas of repeated limit exceedances and a breakdown of how often each contaminant shows level of exceedance out of the total number of tests drawn for the year.

 ## Methodology
 This project follows a simple yet detailed roadmap from raw, sourced data to a simple to follow, interactive vizualization which can both easily display findings whilst also paving the way for further analyses.
 
 1. ### Sourcing Raw Data
    The raw data was sourced from the [Water Quality Portal](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/#countrycode=US&statecode=US%3A06&siteType=Stream&sampleMedia=Water&mimeType=csv&sorted=no&providers=NWIS&providers=STORET) set to extract data from the stations in California for the year 2023 on stream water. This yields two CSV files containining metadata about the individual stations as well as test data throughout the year from said stations.
